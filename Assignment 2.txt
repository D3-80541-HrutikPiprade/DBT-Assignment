Q4)
Ans:
It is not possible to see the first five rows because, when we insert a row in MySQL table, MySQL stores the row wherever it finds the free space,this is to speed up the INSERT statement.
therefore, the rows are not stored sequentially but they are stored ranndomly wherever freespace available. Hence we cannot see the first and last N rows.
